# E-Hentai DB

Just another E-Hentai metadata database


## Requirements

- Node.js 8+

- MySQL 5.3+ / MariaDB 10+


## Setup & Start Up

**If you just want to see the data from `gdata.json`, use `0.1.x`, and if you want to keep your gallery up-to-date, use `0.2.x`. The `master` branch and `0.3.x` and latter includes more features like torrent hashes, and it may takes a long time to sync**

1. `git clone` the repo

2. Run `npm i --production` in the repo directory to install dependencies
    - If you want to build Web UI, use `npm i` directly, then run `npm run build`, the static Web UI files will be in `/dist` directory

3. Download `gdata.json` from [E-Hentai Forums](https://forums.e-hentai.org/index.php?s=&showtopic=201268&view=findpost&p=5474857) and place it into the repo directory

4. Import `struct.sql` into a MySQL / MariaDB database

5. Edit `config.js`, set database username, password, database name, etc.

6. Run `npm run import [file=gdata.json]` to import the JSON file into your database
    - If you want to update to latest galleries, run `npm run sync [host=e-hentai.org] [timestampOffset=0]`
    - If you want to resync gallery metadatas since a few hours ago, run `npm run resync [hour=24]`
    - If you want to mark all replaced galleries, run `npm run mark-replaced` (new galleries will mark them automatically)
    - If you want to get torrents from all galleries, run `npm run torrent-import [host=e-hentai.org]` (USE AT YOUR OWN RISK)
    - If you want to update torrents from torrent list, run `npm run torrent-sync [host=e-hentai.org]`
    - If you want to manually fetch some galleries, run `npm run fetch {gid}/{token} {gid}/{token} ...` or `npm run fetch [filename]`

7. Wait a few minutes, as it has about 800,000 records (on my PC it takes 260s, and on my server it's 850s)

8. Run `npm start`, the server should be run on `8880` port by default config


## Available APIs

All the params can be pass as a part of URL, or put it in search query. Like `/api/gallery/:gid/:token`, you can call it like `/api/gallery/123456/abcdef1234` or `/api/gallery?gid=123456&token=abcdef1234`.

The response type of all APIs are JSON, and follow the format below.

```js
{
    "code": 200,          // 200 = success
    "data": {...},        // response data
    "message": "success", // error message
    "total": 100          // result counts (if `data` is a list)
}
```

`data` should normally be a metadata, or a list of metadata, or `null` if any error happens. The format of metadata is based on E-Hentai's offical gallery JSON API, you can check it on [EHWiki](https://ehwiki.org/wiki/API). But data type may be a little different from offical API, like using `int` for `posted` and `filecount` instead of `string`.

```

Query params:  
- `category`: Gallery category _(required)_
- `page`: Page number _(default: `1`)_
- `limit`: Gallery number per page _(default: `10`, <= `25`)_

Returns: `metadata[]`

### `/api/tag/:tag`  

Get a list of galleries which matches ALL of specific tags, `tag` can be a list split with `,`, then it will returns the matched galleries.

The tag should include the category type of tag, like if you want to search some full-colored Chinese translated furry galleries with male fox, you can try `/api/tag/language:chinese,male:furry,male:fox,full%20color`.

Query params:  
- `tag`: Tags _(required)_
- `page`: Page number _(default: `1`)_
- `limit`: Gallery number per page _(default: `10`, <= `25`)_

Returns: `metadata[]`

### `/api/uploader/:uploader`  

Get a list of galleries which uploaded by soneone.

Query params:  
- `uploader`: Uploader _(required)_
- `page`: Page number _(default: `1`)_
- `limit`: Gallery number per page _(default: `10`, <= `25`)_

Returns: `metadata[]`

### `/api/search`  

Get a list of galleries which matches all the query requests.

The rule of `keyword` supports most operators of [E-Hentai](https://ehwiki.org/wiki/Gallery_Searching):

- Search for gallery title and Japanese title
- Exact terms (`" "`) with spaces
    - Underscore (_) is not supported (use Quotation `" "` instead)
- Wildcard (`*`/`%`) at the end of the pattern (though the query will add `%` by default)
- Exclude (`-`) specific terms
- Or (`~`), matching any one of them [v0.3.1]
- Colon namespaces (`:`) for tags
    - Supports a subset of qualifiers tags: `tag:`, `uploader:`, `gid:` [v0.3.1]
    - Terms without `:` will be treated as title keyword (probably like `title:`?)
- Exact match for tags (`$`)
    - Tags without `$` can be used for prefix match [v0.3.1]
- Shorten tag namespaces (`character:` -> `char:` / `c:`) [v0.3.1]

For usage examples, see [EHWiki](https://ehwiki.org/wiki/Gallery_Searching#Examples).


<details>
<summary>Before v0.3.1:</summary>

- If you want to search an uploader, use `uploader:{uploader}`
- If you want to search a tag, use `{tagType}:{tagName}$`, and if `tagName` contains space, quote it and `$`, like `{tagType}:"{tagName}$"`
- If you want to search a word, just put it, and if it contains space, quote it like `"{keyword}"`

</details>

You can use multiple keywords, split them with space `%20`, relations between all the keywords are `AND` (except `uploder` uses `OR`), so in theory more keywords will get more accure results

Query params:  
- `keyword`: Search keywords, split them with space `%20`
- `category`: Gallery category, same as `/api/category`
- `expunged`: Show expunged gallery _(default: `0`)_
- `removed`: Show removed gallery _(default: `0`)_
- `replaced`: Show replaced gallery _(default: `0`)_
- `minpage`: Show gallery with page count larger than this _(default: `0`)_
- `maxpage`: Show gallery with page count smaller than this _(default: `0`)_
- `minrating`: Show gallery with minimal stars (includes minus half stars) _(default: `0`, <= `5`)_
- `page`: Page number _(default: `1`)_
- `limit`: Gallery number per page _(default: `10`, <= `25`)_

Returns: `metadata[]`


## Notes

### It eats my memory when importing  

The import script will load the WHOLE JSON file (as I prefer to insert the older galleries, so I didn't import them by reading the file in chunk). So when importing, it may eat 1 GB ram or even more, make sure you've setup a swap file on your server

```sh
dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1M count=2048
chmod 0600 swapfile
mkswap swapfile
swapon swapfile
```

### I got duplicate records when re-importing  

~~Do not cancel when importing, as the import script doesn't support resume import, so you'll have to truncate all table or delete them and create a new one~~

Now the import script supports resume importing, you can cancel your imports and run `npm run import` at any time, it'll start from your last record

### The query speed is still too slow when querying multiple tags

Try adding indexes if you want

```sql
ALTER TABLE `gid_tid` ADD UNIQUE(`gid`, `tid`);
ALTER TABLE `gid_tid` ADD INDEX(`tid`);
ALTER TABLE `tag` ADD UNIQUE(`name`);
ALTER TABLE `gallery` ADD INDEX(`category`);
ALTER TABLE `gallery` ADD INDEX(`uploader`);
```

If you want to add all of these indexes, the database size will increased from 330 MB to about 500 MB

### No primary key in table `gid_tid`

I'm not sure should I add an `id` column, as I'm not using it to query. But if you want, try the following SQL, and it'll takes about 110 MB

```sql
ALTER TABLE `gid_tid` ADD `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY FIRST;
```

### Why MyISAM?

I've little knowledge with database, you can change `struct.sql` to use InnoDB or others you want

### The server quits when I exit the terminal  

Try `npm start &`, or use `PM2` or `forever` to keep it running in background

### Web UI is not included in git repository  

They may in GitHub release page, but if it's not here, you can build it by yourself, just run as simple as `npm i` then `npm run build`, and set `webui` to `true` in `config.js`.

### Why React, React Router, Moment.js ... are in `devDependencies`?

I prefer it's a Node.js project, and Web UI is just an optional function, also you can grab distributed Web UI files without building it. Whether you need Web UI or not, the front-end libraries are not touched when you setting up the server, as they've been packaged into distributed files.
